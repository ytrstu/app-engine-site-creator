## Overview ##

App Engine Site Creator is designed to be a highly extensible and light weight content management system.  It features a user-friendly content editing interface, a high degree of flexibility and customization, a file sharing mechanism, full support for page hierarchies, and fine-grained mechanisms for user management and access controls.  It is built to run on Google App Engine and to scale well with minimal engineering maintenance.

See DeploymentInstructions for details on how to customize and deploy your own instance.  For a more in-depth discussion of Site Creator, see the TechnicalOverview.
